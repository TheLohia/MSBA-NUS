## [OptiShelf: Maximizing Sales with Smart Shelf Space Allocation](https://github.com/TheLohia/MSBA-NUS/blob/main/Operations%20Research%20and%20Analytics/Shelf_Space_Allocation_Problem.pdf)

### Description

We tackle the Shelf Space Allocation Problem (SSAP) to optimize product placement on store shelves, maximizing sales while considering real-world constraints such as merchandising agreements, store policies, and customer purchasing behavior.

### Outcome

We successfully formulated a simplified version of the NP-Hard Shelf Space Allocation Problem (SSAP). To tackle its complexity, we divided the problem into two components. The first component allocated products to cabinets without considering shelf space, while the second component focused on allocating appropriate shelf space within each cabinet. Using a toy dataset and the Gurobi optimizer, we achieved near-optimal solutions.

Although our solution overlooks industry conditions like changing inventory and demands, it serves as a baseline for future improvements. The output from our solver showed convergence and the potential to maximize revenue. In future work, we recommend incorporating heuristics to simplify the search for optimal solutions and using real data to eliminate the simplifying assumptions made in our initial solution.
